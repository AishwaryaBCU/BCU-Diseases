                <h3>About Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
                <p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to memory loss and cognitive decline. It is the most common cause of dementia among older adults, affecting their ability to carry out daily activities.</p>
                
                <h3>Understanding the Condition</h3>
                <p>Alzheimer's disease involves the build-up of proteins in the brain, such as amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which disrupt neural communication and lead to cell death. Early symptoms often include difficulty remembering recent events, while later stages can involve severe memory impairment, confusion, and mood changes.</p>
                
                <h3>Risk Factors and Prevention</h3>
                <p>Risk factors for Alzheimer's include age, genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. While there is no cure, certain lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and cognitive training, may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's or slow its progression.</p>
